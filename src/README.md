# SimpleAI

A self-hosted alternative to the not-so-open AI API. It mostly focus on replicating the main endpoints for LLM:

- Text completion
- Chat
- Edits

While it is not an exact replication of the original endpoints, it should be relatively to switch from one to the other, allowing you to experiment with competing approaches quickly and easily.

To install it, simply run `pip install simple_ai_server` (requires Python 3.8 or later).

See more details, license and examples in [the project repository](https://github.com/lhenault/simpleAI).
